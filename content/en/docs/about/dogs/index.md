## Why I compete with my dogs

I have been training and showing dogs for many years. I like the relationship that I build with my dogs when I train them for specific sports. Training is a fun, intellectual challenge.

My dogs are also my companions. I take them hiking, canoeing, and camping.

## George

**Registered Name**: Primah's Dragonslayer

George is a Tibetan Spaniel, a rare and ancient breed that is not a spaniel. Tibentan monks bred Tibbies to be companions and watch dogs.

I plan to show George in conformation and train him for companion events.
