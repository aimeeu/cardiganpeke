## Why I compete with my dogs

I have been training and showing dogs for a long time. I like the relationship that I build with my dogs when I train them for specific sports. Training is also a fun, intellectual challenge.

My dogs are also my companions. I take them hiking, canoeing, and camping.

## Bond

This is Bond, my 9-yr-old Cardigan Welsh Corgi. He has titles in:

* ASCA and AKC Herding
* AKC Scent Work and NACSW Nosework
* AKC Rally
* AKC Fast CAT
