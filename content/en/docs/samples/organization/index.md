## DITA-based approach

I created the organization based on the approached used by the [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/) and [Spinnaker](https://spinnaker.io/docs/) docs.

## Feature-based approach

After feedback from design partners, I changed the Armory Continuous Deployment-as-a-Service navigation to be a feature-based one that adheres to the [Diataxis](https://diataxis.fr/) model of explanation, how-to guides, tutorials, and reference... with a few modifications.
