## Authoring philosophy

I was a software developer as well as an end user, so I approach content creation from that viewpoint. I am as comfortable creating UML diagrams to illustrate concepts as I am creating tutorials and guides.

I strongly believe in separating long, explanatory content from guides and tutorials. You can read more about that approach on Daniele Procida's Diataxis [website](https://diataxis.fr/) site. However, I follow the content and style guides of the company I'm working for or the open source community I'm contributing to.
