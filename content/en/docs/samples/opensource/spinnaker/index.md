## My time on Spinnaker

I contributed to Spinnaker from December 2019 to December 2023, when I worked for Armory. My content contributions consisted of contributor guides, user guides, and developer guides.

I was the SIG Docs Co-Lead when Armory told me to stop my involvement with the Spinnaker docs project.

The first Spinnaker docs repo was called [spinnaker.github.io](https://github.com/spinnaker/spinnaker.github.io/). You can use [this query link](
https://github.com/spinnaker/spinnaker.github.io/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3Aaimeeu+) to view my contributions.

In 2021, the Docs SIG decided to port the Jekyll site to Hugo to improve build times. The current repo is called [spinnaker.io](https://github.com/spinnaker/spinnaker.io/) and you can [view my pull requests](https://github.com/spinnaker/spinnaker.io/pulls?q=is%3Aclosed+is%3Apr+author%3Aaimeeu+).

## Major contributions

I wrote these in 2020.

I used SnagIt's scrolling feature to capture the screenshots. The main content is mostly good, but the left and right menus duplicate.

### Test a plugin

[View the original pull request](https://github.com/spinnaker/spinnaker.github.io/pull/1906).

This guide is aimed at plugin developers and shows how to test a plugin.

Note that there are some broken image links and errant characters. It looks like these were missed when converting from Jekyll to Hugo.
