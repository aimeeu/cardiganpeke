## Recent contributions

My most recent work is in the [Spinnaker]({{< ref "spinnaker/index.md" >}}) and [Kubernetes]({{< ref "kubernetes.md" >}}) projects.

When I worked for AT&T, I contributed to OpenStack and OPNFV projects. Additionally, I was the Docs Lead for the Acumos AI project when AT&T and Tech Mahindra made it an open source project under the Linux Foundation umbrella.
