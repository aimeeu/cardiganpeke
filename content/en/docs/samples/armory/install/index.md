  This page shows samples of installation guides that I wrote while working for Armory.

## Overview

Armory had two standalone product lines:

* Armory Continuous Deployment Self-Hosted (CDSH), an enterprise version of open source [Spinnaker](https://spinnaker.io/).

  * Engineers created the docs site and wrote the majority of content before Armory hired tech writers. I created content and style guides, but to be honest, the tech writing team never had the resources to review and update existing content.
  * Original docs website: https://docs.armory.io/continuous-deployment/
  * Original public GitHub repo: https://github.com/armory/docs/

* Spinnaker Plugins, feature plugins for Spinnaker and Armory Continuous Deployment Self-Hosted.

  * I created the _Spinnaker Plugins_ top-level directory and refactored some existing content into it. The engineers and I created the majority of the content in the plugins directory. When it made sense, I used a DITA-based organization. However, readers and product managers preferred a feature-based site navigation. The PMs and I were working on refactoring when Harness bought Armory.
  * Original docs website: https://docs.armory.io/plugins/
  * Original public GitHub repo: https://github.com/armory/docs/plugins/

I wrote these installation guides during my first two years at Armory.

I used Snagitâ€™s scrolling feature to capture the screenshots. The main body content is correct, but you do see duplicate left and right menus due to the scrolling capture.
