## My time at Armory

I started as a Technical Writer and ended as a Principal Technical Writer. 

When Harness acquired Armory, I was responsible for all Armory product documentation.

* Armory Continuous Deployment-as-a-Service

  * [Website](https://developer.armory.io/)
  * Public GitHub [repo](https://github.com/armory/docs-cdaas)

  I was the sole tech writer for this product and created the vast majority of the content with minimal input from the engineers. This site started out with a DITA-based navigation consisting of Get Started, Concepts, Guides, Reference, Tutorials, Troubleshooting, and Release Notes. However, our end users preferred feature-based navigation, so the Product Manager and I refactored to serve our readers. Each feature directory contains concept and task material. Tutorials remained in the Tutorials section.

* Armory Continuous Deployment Self-Hosted (CDSH)

  * [Website](https://docs.armory.io/continuous-deployment/)
  * Public GitHub [repo](https://github.com/armory/docs/)

  Engineers created much of the CDSH content before I arrived at Armory in December, 2019. Our small docs team never had the bandwidth to update existing content to match the style and content guides I wrote.

  I wrote product installation guides and plugin creation guides.

* Spinnaker Plugins

  * [Website](https://docs.armory.io/plugins/)
  * Public GitHub [repo](https://github.com/armory/docs/)

  I created this top-level section and moved some plugin content from the main CDSH docs to this new section. 

  I created content based on user stories, technical design docs, and collaboration with engineers who were not native English speakers.

  Each plugin should have three installation options: Armory CDSH, Spinnaker â€“ Operator, and Spinnaker- Halyard. I created the install YAML since the engineers often forgot to include it. Then I asked for technical reviews to ensure the content was correct.

  The Scale Agent plugin content illustrates DITA-based navigation. The Product Manager and I had started planning for refactoring to a feature-based navigation when Armory was acquired. For the content, I collaborated with engineers who were not non-native English speakers.
