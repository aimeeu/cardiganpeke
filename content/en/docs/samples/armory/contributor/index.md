## Why I created these guides

When I started at Armory, the docs team didn't have any contributor guides, so I created them. Armory's docs repo was public, so I wrote guides that were appropriate for the general public as well as Armory employees.

My reference points were the Kubernetes contributor guides that I worked on in 2019 while employed by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.

Original public repo: https://github.com/armory/docs/tree/master/content/en/contribute

Original public site: https://docs.armory.io/contribute/

I used Snagit's scrolling feature to capture the screenshots. The main body content is correct, but you do see duplicate left and right menus due to the scrolling capture.

## Style guide

When creating content for Armory, we followed these style guides:

1. Armory Style Guide
1. [Google developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style)
1. [The Chicago Manual of Style](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html)

## Content guide

I divided content into these areas:

1. Concept or explanation
1. How-to or task
1. Tutorial
1. Reference
1. Troubleshooting
