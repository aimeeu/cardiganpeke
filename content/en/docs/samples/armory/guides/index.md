## Configure a temporary preview link to a deployed service

>I received brief notes from the engineer who implemented the feature. I then created the CD-as-a-Service deployment configuration YAML file and then used the Armory CLI to deploy the sample app that Armory engineers built for demos.

## Configure traffic management with Istio
