## Authoring philosophy

I was a software developer as well as an end user, so I approach content creation from that viewpoint. I am as comfortable creating UML diagrams to illustrate concepts as I am creating tutorials and guides.

I strongly believe in separating long, explanatory content from guides and tutorials. You can read more about that approach on Daniele Procida's Diátaxis [website](https://diataxis.fr/). However, I do follow the content and style guides of the company I'm working for or the open source community to which I'm contributing.

## Diátaxis vs DITA et al

DITA (Darwin Information Typing Architecture) is a [method for organizing content](https://technicalwriterhq.com/writing/technical-writing/darwin-information-typing-architecture-dita/) as well as a [method for authoring content](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/dita/faq.php).

Tom Johnson's [What is Diátaxis and should you be using it with your documentation?](https://idratherbewriting.com/blog/what-is-diataxis-documentation-framework) is an interesting read, especially since Tom compares Diátaxis to DITA, [Information Mapping](https://informationmapping.com/), and [The Good Docs Project](https://thegooddocsproject.dev/).

Here are a few presentations on Diátaxis:

* [Introducing the Diátaxis Approach to Technical Documentation](https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/9273/594742) (2023)
* Two-part workshop (2022):
  * [Python Docs Community Workshop: Introduction to Diataxis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=710uQqIqsWk) 
  * [Python Docs Community Workshop: Getting Things Done](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECXtMPx-4uQ)
* [Daniele Procida - Always complete, never finished](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7n7uIg4AM) (2021)
* [What nobody tells you about documentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4vKPhjcMZg)  (2017)

Although I have never authored content using DITA tools, I have organized content using a DITA approach. What I found was that users preferred a feature-based navigation, so I put explanatory pages and guides within each feature folder but put Tutorials in a Tutorials section. The Diátaxis approach allows for variation in navigation structure.
